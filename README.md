A simple React clone of the CakeOmeter at:

http://www.cakebaker.co.uk/baking-tin-size-conversion-calculator.html

Converts cake recipes from one baking tin to another
(square or round). Uses LocalStorage so your inputs won't
get lost.

This was built with `create-react-app`, so the usual commands
can be run, such as `npm start` to open the site in your browser,
and `npm run build` to build for production.
